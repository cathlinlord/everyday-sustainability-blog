For me and many others, dining has been a large contributor to my waste.
Being a college student without a kitchen, most of my food is from dining halls,
which some of provide disposable utensils for when purchasing on-the-go meals.
Students, professionals, and take-out eaters are often contributing to the
plastic build up in landfills through once-use utensils and it’s time to make
this come to an end! The solution? Sporks! Sporks! Sporks! Apparently KFC has
been doing something right, now it’s just time to make the sporks reusable. It’s
every utensil you could need for a meal in one and Light My Fire of Sweden is
here to provide. This company provides multiple types of sporks all made from
bioplastics. I know, that contains the word “plastic” in it, but that’s okay!
Bioplastic can mean two things, either bio-based or biodegradable. This meaning
they are plant based products and can be recycled or broken down by natural
material. Order your spork today, use daily, clean often, and eat some food!
To reach the same effect as the toothbrushes, you can also find bamboo sporks!)
