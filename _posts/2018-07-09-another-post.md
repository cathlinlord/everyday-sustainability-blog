The company, the Giving Brush, is taking strides to promote plastic free
toothbrushes, through selling multiple designs of toothbrushes. All bamboo
based, just pick out your color! The company got its start when one of the
co-founders was surfing off the coast of California and was disturbed by a
clump of trash that contained multiple plastic toothbrushes. Since then, they
have been selling toothbrushes that are made out of Moso bamboo. This product
is highly sustainable because bamboo is the fastest growing plant on earth!
Giving Brush products are made free of additive chemicals, is non-toxic, and
vegan. Purchase your Giving Brush today to help them reach supplying ¼ of the
