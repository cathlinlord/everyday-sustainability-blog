Here at Everyday Sustainability, we are all about sea turtles. When swimming
and looking for food, turtles often mistaken plastic bags for jellyfish, eat
them, and then pay horrible consequences. We want to see this end!! The easiest
way to reduce plastic bag use is through reusable grocery bags. Through the
website, Earth Hero, you can purchase a set of reusable grocery bags that are
perfect for all of your shopping needs! Check out the Mindful Grocer Kit and
save the turtles!
