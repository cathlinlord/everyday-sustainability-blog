Products that are only used once, including straws, have detrimental effects
on the Earth. Plastic straws either get stuck in a landfill for hundreds of
years or floating through the ocean, potentially harming a sea creature,
especially sea turtles. Either option is not good. The Klean Kanteen offers
stainless steel straws to cut down on the 500 million plastic straws that are
used by Americans Daily.These straws can virtually be used for any drink, in
any cup. This including Klean Kanteen’s Insulated Tumblers (which you should
also look into purchasing to cut down on plastic bottles and once use coffee
cups!). Do your part in reducing the number of people using plastic straws
today by purchasing these reusable straws today. And remember, save the
Sea Turtles!
